Config

DEFINITION Config;

	PROCEDURE Setup;

END Config.


BlackBox attempts to call the command Config.Setup during start-up. The call allows to customize the configuration of BlackBox. Module Config is provided in source form and can be changed by the programmer arbitrarily. The default implementation looks like this:

	MODULE Config;

		IMPORT Dialog;

		PROCEDURE Setup*;
			VAR res: INTEGER;
		BEGIN

			(* ... various file and clipboard converters are installed here ... *)

			Dialog.Call("StdLog.Open", "", res)
		END Setup;

	END Config.

This configuration causes the log window to be opened upon startup. The command is called after the complete BlackBox library, framework, and standard subsystems are loaded. Config may import any BlackBox module. If it isn't needed, module Config can be deleted.

PROCEDURE Setup
This procedure can be implemented in order to customize the initial BlackBox configuration after start-up. It is called after all standard services and menus have been installed.
Implementing Setup is optional.
Example for the implementation of Config.Setup:

	PROCEDURE Setup*;
		VAR res: INTEGER;
	BEGIN
		Dialog.Call("StdCmds.OpenAuxDialog('System/Rsrc/About', 'Splash Screen')", "", res)
	END Setup;

If Config.Setup need not be implemented, the module (in particular its code file) may be deleted entirely.


Note that similar to Config, there may (but need not) be a module Startup with a command Setup. It has a similar purpose as Config, but is called before the higher levels (text subsystem, form subsystem, etc.) are loaded. Consequently, Startup may not import the higher levels of BlackBox. Normally, Startup does not exist. It is only used under special circumstances, e.g., to overwrite the variable Dialog.appName.
