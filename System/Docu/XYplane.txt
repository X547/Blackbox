This module is provided for compatibility with the book "Programming in Oberon" by Reiser/Wirth. It is useful when learning the language. It is not recommended for use in production programs.


CONST erase
This value can be passed to parameter mode in procedure Dot. It indicates that a white dot should be placed at the given coordinates.

CONST draw
This value can be passed to parameter mode in procedure Dot. It indicates that a black dot should be placed at the given coordinates.


VAR X, Y, W, H
These values define the rectangle in which drawing occurs. (X, Y) is the lower-left corner of the rectangle, (W, H) its size. In BlackBox, (X, Y) is always (0, 0). Unlike the port model of BlackBox, XYplane has its origin at the lower-left corner of the drawing area, and positive Y values above the origin.


PROCEDURE Open
Opens a new window for drawing. The window's contents is cleared to white.

PROCEDURE Dot (x, y, mode: INTEGER)
Draws a white dot (mode = erase) or a black dot (mode = draw).

PROCEDURE IsDot (x, y: INTEGER): BOOLEAN
Returns whether the dot at (x, y) is white (FALSE) or black (TRUE).

PROCEDURE ReadKey (): CHAR
If a key has been pressed, it is returned as result. Otherwise, 0X is returned.

PROCEDURE Clear
Erases the whole drawing area (setting it to white).
