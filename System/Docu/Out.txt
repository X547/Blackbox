PROCEDURE Open
Brings open log window to the top. If no log window is open, a new one is opened.

PROCEDURE Char (ch: CHAR)
Writes a character into the log.

PROCEDURE Ln
Writes a carriage return into the log.

PROCEDURE Int (i: LONGINT; n: INTEGER)
Writes an integer number into the log, with n digits. If n is too small (e.g., 0) to represent the number correctly, the necessary minimal number of digits is used.

PROCEDURE Real (x: REAL; n: INTEGER)
Writes a real number into the log, with n digits. If n is too small (e.g., 0) to represent the number correctly, the necessary minimal number of digits is used.

PROCEDURE String (str: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Writes a string into the log.
