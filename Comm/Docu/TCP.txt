CommTCP

Driver for CommStreams.
It implements TCP/IP streams, using the operating system's sockets interface. It provides the NewListener and NewStream factory functions as needed for CommStreams. Do not import CommTCP directly; instead, use CommStreams and specify "CommTCP" as the protocol name.

Parameters localAdr and remoteAdr:
The CommStreams procedures NewStream and NewListener feature string parameters remoteAdr and localAdr. The interpretation of the strings passed depends on the implementation of the actual driver module. For CommTCP the following holds.

The remoteAdr (only used with NewStream) must be either an IP address or a host's name, followed by a colon (":") and a port number. (Examples: "127.0.0.1:2", "loopback:2".)

The parameter localAdr identifies the port on which a listener is established (NewListener) or from which a remote connection is attempted (NewStream). Valid values are
-	an empty string
-	an IP address or a host's name (Examples: "127.0.0.1", "loopback")
-	an IP address or a host's name followed by a colon (":") and a port number
(Examples: "127.0.0.1:2", "loopback:2")
-	a port number (Example: "2")
For unspecified parts, IP addresses / host's names or port numbers respectively, a wildcard is used, directing the operating system to choose freely. If in a call to NewListener neither IP address nor host name is specified for localAdr, the listener will check on all IP numbers available on the local machine.
Note: Certain operating systems (e.g. Microsoft Windows Server 2003) do not accept an empty string or just a port number as valid values for localAdr. Use the values "0.0.0.0:0" or "0.0.0.0:<port number>" (e.g. "0.0.0.0:2") instead.
