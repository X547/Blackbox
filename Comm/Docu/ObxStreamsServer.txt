This module provides an example of how to program a server using CommStreams. A sample client is provided by the module CommObxStreamsClient.

The server waits for a connect. Whenever a client requests a new connection a separate TextView is opened by the server and everything received through this connection is displayed in the TextView.

Per machine only one server is permitted to run at a time.

Try - to start / stop the server:
 CommObxStreamsServer.Start
 CommObxStreamsServer.Stop


PROCEDURE Start
Starts the server.

PROCEDURE Stop
Stops the server.
