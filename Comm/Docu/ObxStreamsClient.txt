CommObxStreamsClient

DEFINITION CommObxStreamsClient;

	PROCEDURE SendTextSelection;

END CommObxStreamsClient.


This module acts as a client for CommObxStreamsServer. The command sends the current text selection to the server, which opens it in a new TextView. The server is expected to run on the same machine and to be started first. It may, however, run in a BlackBox process separate from the one in which the client runs.

Try (after starting the server and selecting some text):
 CommObxStreamsClient.SendTextSelection

PROCEDURE SendTextSelection
Sends a text selection to the server.
