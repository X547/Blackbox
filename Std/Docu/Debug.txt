StdDebug

DEFINITION StdDebug;

END StdDebug.


For a distribution version of a BlackBox application or component, use this limited version of the BlackBox debugger. This limited version doesn't allow to follow pointers and similar interactions, it only creates a passive display of the error state. Since this is a text document that can be saved, it enables the user to send error information to the developer (e.g., via StdCoder).
StdDebug is installed during startup of BlackBox, if the full DevDebug could  not be found.
