StdApi is programming interface to many of the services provided by StdCmds. Since StdCmds is intended to be used in menus, hyperlinks etc., it is not always suitable as a programming interface. StdApi provides the exact same functionality but with a more "programmable" interface.

PROCEDURE CloseDialog (OUT closedView: Views.View)
This command closes the currently focused window. If the window is a document window and its contents dirty, an error message will be displayed. The root view of the closed window is returned in closedView. If CloseDialog failed NIL is returned.

PROCEDURE OpenAux (file, title: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Takes a file specification of a BlackBox document and a window title as parameters, and opens an auxiliary window with the specified title. Parameter file must be the path name of a file. The root view of the opened window is returned in v. If OpenAux fails NIL is returned in v.
Auxiliary windows are used for displaying temporary editable data.

PROCEDURE OpenAuxDialog (file, title: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Takes a file specification of a BlackBox document and a window title as parameters, and opens a dialog with the specified document. The dialog is opened as an auxiliary window. Parameter file must be the path name of a file. The root view of the opened window is returned in v. If OpenAuxDialog fails NIL is returned in v.
Auxiliary dialogs are used for self-contained dialogs, i.e., data entry masks or parameter entry masks for commands.
In contrast to OpenAux, OpenAuxDialog turns the opened document into mask mode if it is a container (-> Containers), and opens it into a dialog window if the underlying platform distinguishes between document and dialog windows (e.g. as in Windows).

PROCEDURE OpenBrowser (file, title: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Takes a file specification of a BlackBox document and a window title as parameters, and opens the specified document in an auxiliary window. The window contents is not editable, but can be selected. Parameter file must be the path name of a file. The root view of the opened window is returned in v. If OpenBrowser fails NIL is returned in v.
Browser windows are used for displaying documentation. It is possible to select and copy out browser window contents. It is possible to apply find & replace commands, the Info->Interface command, etc.


PROCEDURE OpenCopyOf (file: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Opens a new document and uses the document specified by file as a template to initialize the new document. If successful the root view of the new document is returned in v otherwise NIL is returned in v.

PROCEDURE OpenDoc (file: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Takes a file specification of a BlackBox document as parameter, and opens the document in a document window. Parameter file must be the path name of a file. If the same file is already open in an existing document window, this window is brought to the top, instead of opening a new window. The root view of the opened window (or window brought to the top) is returned in v. If OpenDoc fails NIL is returned in v.
Document windows are used for displaying persistent editable data.

PROCEDURE OpenToolDialog (file, title: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT v: Views.View)
Takes a file specification of an BlackBox document and a window title as parameters, and opens a dialog with the specified document. The dialog is opened as tool window. Parameter file must be the path name of a file. The root view of the opened window is returned in v. If OpenAuxDialog fails NIL is returned in v.
Tool dialogs are used for dialogs which operate on document windows beneath them, e.g., a Find & Replace dialog which operates on a text under it. Otherwise it is identical to OpenAuxDialog.
