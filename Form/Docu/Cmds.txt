VAR grid: RECORD
Interactor for the grid dialog box (Form/Rsrc/Cmds).

resolution: INTEGER	resolution > 0
If metricSystem, then resolution specifies how many grid positions exist for one millimeter.
If ~metricSystem, then resolution specifies how many grid positions exist for 1/16 inch.
A higher value means that higher precision is possible.

metricSystem: BOOLEAN
Determines whether the metric system (millimeters) is used or not (1/16 inches).


PROCEDURE AlignBottom
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their bottom sides are aligned to the bottommost view in the selection.

PROCEDURE AlignLeft
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their left sides are aligned to the leftmost view in the selection.

PROCEDURE AlignRight
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their right sides are aligned to the rightmost view in the selection.

PROCEDURE AlignTop
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their top sides are aligned to the topmost view in the selection.

PROCEDURE AlignBottom
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their bottom sides are aligned to the bottommost view in the selection.

PROCEDURE AlignToRow
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their vertical centers become aligned horizontally.

PROCEDURE AlignToColumn
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Move all selected views such that their horizontal centers become aligned vertically.

PROCEDURE InitGridDialog
Guard: FormCmds.FocusGuard
Sets up grid.resolution and grid.metricSystem according to the values of the focus controller.

PROCEDURE SetGrid
Guard: FormCmds.FocusGuard
Sets the focus view's grid and gridFactor to the values determined by grid.resolution and grid.metricSystem.

PROCEDURE SelectOffGridViews
Guard: FormCmds.FocusGuard
Selects all views in the focus form whose top-left corners don't lie on the grid.

PROCEDURE ForceToGrid
Guard: FormCmds.FocusGuard
Moves all views in the focus form such that their top-left corners come to lie on the grid.

PROCEDURE SetAsFirst
Guard: FormCmds.SingletonGuard
Sets the selected view to the first position ("bottom").

PROCEDURE SetAsLast
Guard: FormCmds.SingletonGuard
Sets the selected view to the last position ("top").

PROCEDURE SortViews
Guard: FormCmds.FocusGuard
Sorts the back-to-front order of all views in a form such that they are geometrically sorted, i.e., a view whose upper edge is further up, or at the same hight but further to the left, is considered to come before ("lower") than the other one.

PROCEDURE InsertAround
Guard: FormCmds.SelectionGuard
Inserts a group box around the currently selected views.

PROCEDURE FocusGuard (VAR par: Dialog.Par)
This guard disables the current menu item if the current front focus isn't a form view.

PROCEDURE SelectionGuard (VAR par: Dialog.Par)
This guard disables the current menu item if the current front focus isn't a form view, or if it doesn't contain a selection.

PROCEDURE SingletonGuard (VAR par: Dialog.Par)
This guard disables the current menu item if the current front focus isn't a form view, or if it doesn't contain a singleton.
