Module SqlDB is the application programming interface for applications using relational databases supporting the SQL language.


names
The constant names can be used as the row parameter in a table's Read method. This is legal if the passed interactor is of type Row. The interactor is filled with the column names of the actual table.

converted
Possible value of a table's res field after a Read operation. Indicates that some database values had to be converted to match the type of the corresponding interactor field.

truncated
Possible value of a table's res field after a Read operation. Indicates that some string values had to be truncated to fit in the corresponding interactor field.

overflow
Possible value of a table's res field after a Read operation. Indicates that some numeric values could not be read because they where too large to fit in the corresponding interactor field.

incompatible
Possible value of a table's res field after a Read operation. Indicates that some database values could not be read because of a type incompatibility

noData
Possible value of a table's res field after a Read operation. Indicates that the row parameter pointed to a non-existing row.

sync
Possible value for the async parameter of OpenDatabase.

async
Possible value for the async parameter of OpenDatabase.

hideErrors
Possible value for the showErr parameter of OpenDatabase, and of the showErrors field of a database object.

showErrors
Possible value for the showErr parameter of OpenDatabase, and of the showErrors field of a database object.


TYPE Row
A Row variable contains a textual representation of a single row of a database. An interactor of this type can be used as parameter of the Table.Read operation when a textual representation of an unknown table is to be retrieved.

fields: POINTER TO ARRAY OF String
The actual fields of the table row. The array is allocated by the Table.Read operation. fields is allocated by SqlDB if it is NIL or the length is not correct, otherwise the existing array is reused. The same holds for the string pointers in fields, except that a string is not reallocated if the new value fits into the old string.


TYPE Blob
Used for the representation of data of any kind and size ("binary large object").

len: INTEGER	len >= 0
The length of the data in bytes.

data: POINTER TO ARRAY OF BYTE	 len > 0 => data # NIL
The binary data stored as an array of character. There is no special termination symbol in the array.


TYPE Par
Basetype for extensible parameter lists.


TYPE Command
Procedure type with extensible parameter list, used in Database.Call.


TYPE TableCommand
Procedure type with table argument and extensible parameter list, used in Table.Call. 


TYPE Database
ABSTRACT
A Database variable represents an SQL database.

res: INTEGER
Result value; valid after opening the database, and after each call to Database.Exec or Database.NewTable.

async: BOOLEAN
Set from the async parameter of OpenDatabase. async = TRUE means asynchronous operation is allowed.

showErrors: BOOLEAN
Can be set to enforce the database driver to display verbose error messages if an SQL statement is incorrect. 

PROCEDURE (d: Database) Exec (statement: ARRAY OF CHAR)
NEW, ABSTRACT
Execute the SQL statement passed as parameter. It must not be a table-returning statement.
If d has been opened in async mode, the evaluation of statement is only started; it will be completed asynchronously.
The following portable error codes may be returned in res:
	5	outOfTables
	6	notExecutable
	9	tooManyBlobs
Warning: don't use the SQL transaction statements (commit / abort), since they may interfere with SqlDB. Instead, call db.Commit or db.Abort.

Pre
statement # ""	20
statement is not table-returning	21	(* may be delayed *)

Post
res denotes error value (0 if no error occurred)

PROCEDURE (d: Database) NewTable (): Table
NEW, ABSTRACT
Allocate a new table object. A table represents the result table of the most recently executed SQL statement on it.

Post
result # NIL
	d.res = 0
	result.base = d
	result.rows = 0
	result.columns = 0
	result.res = 0
	result.strictNotify = FALSE
result = NIL
	d.res # 0

PROCEDURE (d: Database) Call (command: Command; par: Par);
NEW, ABSTRACT
The procedure command(par) is executed. par may be NIL. Inside command no table based operations (Table.Read, Table.Exec, Table.Clear, or Table.Call) may be invoked on an existing table. Operations on tables allocated (with Database.NewTable) inside the command are legal.
This procedure is useful in asynchronously executing statements.

Pre
command # NIL	20

PROCEDURE (d: Database) Commit
NEW, ABSTRACT
Commits the currently executing transaction. Note that a transaction need not be started explicitly.
Do not use the database's SQL transaction commands directly.

PROCEDURE (d: Database) Rollback
NEW, ABSTRACT
Aborts the currently executing transaction. Note that a transaction need not be started explicitly.
Do not use the database's SQL transaction commands directly.


TYPE Table
ABSTRACT
A table represents the result of an SQL query, typically of a SELECT statement. The result table is a snapshot, i.e., retains the state which was valid when the query has been performed.

base-: Database	base # NIL
The database to which the table belongs.

rows: INTEGER	rows >= 0
The number of rows that the most recent query returned. If the actual database driver cannot return the number of rows in a query, rows is set to MAX(INTEGER).

columns: INTEGER	columns >= 0
The number of columns that the most recent query returned.
columns = 0 means no table was returned.

res: INTEGER
The result value of the most recent query (0 if no error).

strictNotify: BOOLEAN
After one or several SQL queries have been performed on the table and BlackBox is idle again, a Dialog.Update is performed automatically by an action (-> Services). This is normally the desired behavior. If the result state after each query should be reflected in controls bound to the table's interactor, strictNotify should be set. This may be desired for long-running commands, so that the user sees progress while the command is running.

PROCEDURE (t: Table) InitBase (base: Database)
NEW
Initialize the table's base pointer.
InitBase is called internally.

Pre
base # NIL	20
t.base = NIL  OR  t.base = base	21

Post
t.base = base

PROCEDURE (t: Table) Exec (statement: ARRAY OF CHAR)
NEW, ABSTRACT
Execute the SQL statement passed as parameter. It must be a row-returning statement. Exec first performs t.Clear in order to flush the old result table, then executes the query.
If t.base has been opened in async mode, the evaluation of statement is only started and will be completed asynchronously.
The following portable error codes may be returned in res:
	5	outOfTables
	6	notExecutable
	9	tooManyBlobs

Pre
statement # ""	20
t is legal table in enclosing command	21

Post
res denotes error value (0 if no error occurred).

PROCEDURE (t: Table) Available (): BOOLEAN;
NEW, ABSTRACT
Tells whether Read can execute immediately. This procedure is rarely used. It should be used before a Read is performed, if it is not guaranteed that the previous Exec has already returned a result. This may only happen if Exec is performed asynchronously. Note that Available() only guarantees that a result table has become available, but this table may well be empty (columns = 0 and rows = 0).

PROCEDURE (t: Table) Read (row: INTEGER; VAR data: ANYREC)
NEW, ABSTRACT
Reads the row'th row of the result table into the interactor data.
The generic data type Row which consists of an open array of strings can be used to read a row of data from an arbitrary table. All table values are converted to a string representation in this case. Otherwise the fields of the data record must be of one of the following types:
BYTE, SHORTINT, INTEGER, SHORTREAL, REAL, BOOLEAN, ARRAY n OF CHAR; POINTER TO ARRAY OF CHAR, Dialog.Currency, Dialog.List, Dialog.Combo, Dates.Date, Dates.Time, or SqlDB.Blob. Other array and record types are handled recursively. Pointers are dereferenced, and the bound structures are handled recursively. Pointers must not be NIL with the exception of POINTER TO ARRAY OF CHAR. If such a pointer is NIL or the bound array is too small to receive the corresponding string, a new array of suitable length is allocated automatically.
Four levels of complications can arise during the read:
• A value has to be converted from one data type to another. Conversions from any type to strings (ARRAY n OF CHAR or POINTER TO ARRAY OF CHAR) are always supported. Other conversions are driver-dependent.
• A string need to be truncated because the destination array is too small.
• A numeric value is too large to be stored in the destination (overflow).
• A value cannot be assigned because its type is incompatible with the corresponding field. The field is cleared in such a situation.
After the call, t.res contains the most serious event (in the order converted, truncated, overflow, incompatible) that happened during the reading of all columns.
The column names of the table can be read into a variable of type Row, using the special value names for the row parameter.
It is permissible to read past the end of the table (row >= t.rows). The whole interactor is cleared in this case and t.res is set to noData.

Pre
t.columns > 0	20;	(* may be delayed *)
row >= 0  OR  row = names & data IS Row	21
data contains legal data types	22	(* may be delayed *)
data contains no NIL pointers	23	(* may be delayed *)
t.base.async => data is global variable	24
t is legal table in enclosing command	25

Post
t.res IN {0, converted, truncated, overflow, incompatible, noData}

PROCEDURE (t: Table) Clear
NEW, ABSTRACT
Releases the resources needed to represent the most recently created result table of t.

Pre
t is legal table in enclosing command	20

Post
t.rows = 0
t.columns = 0
t.res = 0

PROCEDURE (t: Table) Call (command: TableCommand; par: Par)
NEW, ABSTRACT
The procedure command(t, par) is executed. par may be NIL. Inside command no table based operations (Table.Read, Table.Exec, Table.Clear, or Table.Call) may be invoked on a preexisting table different from t. Operations on tables allocated (with Database.NewTable) inside the command are legal.
This procedure is useful for asynchronously executing commands.

Pre
command # NIL	20
t is legal table in enclosing command	21


VAR debug: BOOLEAN
Used internally. (Shows a protocol of what is happening during the execution of SqlDB commands.)

PROCEDURE  OpenDatabase (protocol, id, password, datasource: ARRAY OF CHAR;
													async, showErr: BOOLEAN; OUT d: Database; OUT res: INTEGER)
Open the database specified by the parameters. protocol is the name of the module which contains the database driver, e.g., "SqlOdbc" or "SqlOdbc3". Note that these names are case sensitive. id is a driver-specific string which denotes the connection information for the network in use, or similar protocol-specific information. password is the password used to log into the DBMS. It may be empty; in this case the user may be prompted for the password, depending on the driver. datasource specifies the database to be opened. It should be a unique name for the particular protocol.
If the database described by protocol and datasource is already open in the same BlackBox environment, the same database connection may be used, without considering the password again.
Consult the driver documentation for further information on the parameters to be passed.
If async is true, the returned database object is allowed to behave asynchronously.
If showErr is true, the returned database displays verbose error messages when incorrect SQL statements are detected.
The following portable error codes may be returned in res:
	1	noDriverMod
	2	noDriverProc
	3	wrongDriverType
	4	connectionsExceeded
	7	cannotOpenDB 
	8	wrongIdentification

Pre
protocol # ""	20

Post
res = 0
	database was correctly opened
	d # NIL
	d.async = async
	d.showErrors = showErr
res # 0
	database couldn't be opened
