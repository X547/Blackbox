Details
#4 (Feature, 2016-04-20): The new icon with up to 256x256 resolution
Original BlackBox icon have only 16x16 and 32x32 resolution set and have some old plain composition.

The new icon for BlackBox is required.

#11 (Documentation, 2016-03-17): About.odc
The file System/Rsrc/About.odc should be updated for maintainnig of new BlackBox. We need to make an clear point to the Center and save old Oberon microsystems copyright. We can use new logo #4.

The information about Version should be included automatically during the build according to the text file AppVersion.txt

The information about build date and time also sould be included in About.odc.

#13 (Bug, 2014-09-17): The compiler ignores some hidden pointer fields, which leads to memory corruption
The compiler ignores hidden pointer fields in base types of a record B when B is nested into another record C. This leads to an inconsistent type descriptor of C and thereby to memory corruption and a system crash.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 19.

#15 (Feature, 2014-10-07): Adapting the About dialog
The 'About' dialog form in file System/Rsrc/About.odc needs to be adapted for the Center edition of BlackBox.
In particular this means:
- adapting the form layout
- changing the logo bitmap
- adding a center copyright notice
- adding a reference to previous work done by Oberon microsystems
- displaying build date, build number, and version information based on System properties rather than hard-coded data

#16 (Bug, 2014-10-07): Fixing a TRAP in DevAnalyzer when reusing FOR-loop variables
When reusing a FOR-loop variable in a nested FOR-loop, DevAnalyzer
generates a TRAP due to an invalid CASE label instead of
reporting error 910 (for loop variable set).
The invalid CASE label results from adding the constant 'noChange' (=16)
to the loop variable's 'num' field for every nesting level.

Reported by Ivan Denisov on 2013-09-02.
Open Point 41 in BB 1.6 release.
CPC 1.7 change list item 44.

#17 (Bug, 2014-10-06): Fixing a bug in command line reading
Command line reading cuts off the last character resulting in 
nondeterministic results for Dialog.commandLinePars.
The bug is caused by an off-by-one error in HostMenus.IncludingFileCommandLine.

Reported by Eugene Temirgaleev 2009-10-11.

CPC 1.7 change list number 27.

#18 (Feature, 2014-10-16): Adding Dialog.appVersion and adapting Dialog.version for upcoming center releases
In BlackBox 1.6 Dialog.version is a 2-digit INTEGER set to 16, which means BlackBox major version 1.6.
This needs to be updated for the center release 1.7.
In order to make a more detailed version information available to BlackBox users it is proposed
to add a string variable Dialog.appVersion initialized with the System property 'appVersion'.
Furthermore it is proposed to use Dialog.appVersion instead of Dialog.version
for displaying the version information in the status bar after startup of BlackBox.
Dialog.version should be set automatically to the major version number
derived from Dialog.appVersion.

Corresponds to CPC change list number 62.

#19 (Feature, 2015-10-12): Adding 16-bit Unicode support for Component Pascal identifiers
BlackBox 1.6 already supports extended ASCII-characters from the ISO-Latin-1 subset of Unicode for Component Pascal identifiers. For the benefit of the Cyrillic or Greek community, for example, it is required to add 16-bit Unicode support. In order to simplify the required changes in the compiler and runtime system and for providing a compact encoding
of plain ASCII-identifiers the UTF-8 encoding shall be used for representing Unicode identifiers both
internally in the compiler and runtime system and externally in symbol and object files. This also has 
the advantage that the symbol and object file formats stay compatible with BB 1.6 as long as plain ASCII
characters are used.  Because Unicode characters may also exist in module names, which are mapped to file names, it is required to add Unicode support to file name handling in a number of modules.

#21 (Bug, 2014-12-15): Caret blink frozen after 49.7 days
If BlackBox is not restarted within 49.7days, you will find the caret of the text editor frozen, i.e. not blinking at all. The reason is an overflow caused by using an INTEGER for the ticks in Controllers.TickMsg instead of LONGINT.

Reported by Ivan Denisov, 2014-11-22.

#22 (Bug, 2015-02-10): HostFiles.NewWriter violating the specification
According to the specification (System/Docu/Files) in case of read-only files (shared) NewWriter should return NIL. The current implementation, however, generates a TRAP. The specification needs to be aligned with the implementation. In order to be able to avoid the TRAP, two new File methods (Shared() and Closed()) should be introduced that return the file's current state.

Reported by Ilya Ermakov, 2009-10-12.

#23 (Bug, 2015-02-10): fixing bugs in WinApi plus some refinements and extensions
Changes as proposed by Koen Desaeger and Helmut Zinn in CPC_1.7 rc4.
Change all occurrences of WINSPOOL.dll to WINSPOOL.drv (Helmut Zinn)
Change all occurrences of VAR [nil] lpData: SHORTCHAR => lpData: PtrVoid (Koen Desaeger)
Change WM_KEYLAST* = 265; to WM_KEYLAST* = 264 (* {3, 8} *);
Some constants and procedures have been added.
Some data types (SHORTCHAR to BOOLEAN, INTEGER VAR-parameter to ARRAY) have been refined in order to describe the intended data type precisely.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc4 change list item 4.

#24 (Bug, 2015-01-26): Fixing the name table handling in DevLinker
DevLinker.LinkDll causes a name table overflow (TRAP in DevLinker.Insert) 
when the average of the involved name lengths is more than about 20.
This is caused by a fixed size of the name table that is appropriate 
only when the names are shorter on average.
Reported by Rainer Neubauer, 2008-02-18

In addition, testing for the need to append the ".dll" suffix in DevLinker.Insert causes a TRAP
when the name table is filled with less than 4 characters.
Reported by Boris Ilov, 2013-08-26.

In addition, the CP compiler accepts longer names than DevLinker does.
This is caused by declaring Name as an ARRAY 40 OF SHORTCHAR in DevLinker instead of 256.
Reported by Josef Templ, 2015-01-15.

Refers to CPC 1.7 change list number 6.

#25 (Bug, 2015-01-26): Fixing a bug in stack overflow handling
After a stack overflow, BB responds with a low-level modal trap dialog.
After closing it and producing another stack overflow, the BB process is terminated.
According to luowy, the reason is that in Kernel.TrapHandler the page guard 
is not set correctly after the first occurrence of a stack overflow.

Reported by OberonCore.
Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 8.

#26 (Bug, 2015-02-02): Fixing bugs in some BlackBox documentation files
Several bugs in BlackBox documentation files fixed.

- Fix links to License file in BB-Road & BB-Rules
- Add "Silent Trap" in Dev/Docu/User-Man & BB-Rules
- Add links to specifications in Host/Docu/PackedFiles
- Add missing Latin-1 characters in BB-Chars
- Extend list of contributors in Contributors
- Correct predefined identifier sort order in CP-Lang
- Change TextCmds.PasteViewGuard to StdCmds.PasteViewGuard in System/Docu/User-Man

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 2.

#27 (Feature, 2015-02-12): Adding SET conversion to the module Strings
Conversion between Component Pascal SET constants and ARRAY OF CHAR is missing from the module Strings.
A proposal exists in CPC 1.7.
The specification needs to be added to System/Docu/Strings.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 30.

#28 (Bug, 2015-02-27): Fixing a bug in Strings.Replace in case of truncation
Strings.Replace does not terminate the resulting string with 0X if truncation is needed.
For example: VAR a: ARRAY 5 OF CHAR; a := "ABCD"; Strings.Replace(a, 1, 1, "xy");
"Reported":http://community.blackboxframework.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=60 by Manuel Martín Sánchez on 2014-03-21.
In addition, the simple case where the string length is not changed should be optimized.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 30.

#29 (Bug, 2015-03-26): inconsistent checks for valid subsystem names
The modules DevSubTool and DevLinkChk use inconsistent rules for checking the syntax of subsystem names
in a procedure called SyntaxOK. In addition, Unicode support needs to be added.
The maximum length of subsystem names should be increased from 8 to 15 characters
as proposed by Fyodor Tkachov on 2008-07-16.

Reported by Manuel Martín Sánchez on 2015-01-30.
Refers to CPC1.7 change list item number 10.

#30 (Bug, 2015-03-10): fixing Kernel.IsAlpha for Japanese Hiragana and Katakana
Kernel.IsAlpha returns FALSE for all Japanese Hiragana and Katakana syllables.
Kernel.IsAlpha uses WinApi.IsCharAlphaW, which returns TRUE only for
characters that are either upper or lower case. Using WinApi.GetStringTypeW
would solve the problem and is about twice as fast.

#32 (Bug, 2015-04-29): Folds arrows display
The folds are displaying wrong way both in Wine (in Linux) and Russian language Windows. With English version of Windows folds displaying well.

#33 (Feature, 2015-04-15): adding platform detection for wine, Windows 7, and Windows 8
Wine detection needs to be added in order to be able to handle differences between Wine and Windows properly.
Platform detection for Windows 7 and 8 needs to be added.
Auxiliary functions (IsWindows, IsMac, etc.) are needed for detecting platform groups such as all Windows platforms conveniently and centralized at one place.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list item 41 and 42.

#34 (Bug, 2015-04-01): fixing the reuse of open documents
When clicking on a link to a help text that is already open within BlackBox,
a new help text window is opened. This is in contrast to the expected behavior of
reusing the open window (bring to front) as it is done when editing documents.
The reason is a very unsystematic treatment of reuse of open documents in BB 1.6
based mainly on the window title.
Related anomalies arise with other document modes (except edit mode)
and need to be taken into account when changing this behavior.
There are also cases with tool dialogs where there is a wrong reuse if
the same window title is used for different documents.
A proposal for a systematic treatment of reuse of open documents based on 
file name, location and document flags instead of window titles is available in CPC 1.7 rc5.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list item 9 and Open Points 05.

#35 (Documentation, 2016-01-27): Add docu for DevSelectors
Add documentation for DevSelectors

#36 (Feature, 2015-04-29): support for long identifiers in StdInterpreter
StdInterpreter uses an ARRAY 32 OF CHAR for identifiers, which means that 
identifiers longer than 31 characters are not supported. This should be
aligned with the CP compiler, which supports identifiers up to 255 characters.

Reported by Rainer Neubauer, 2012-06-09.
Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list item 11.

#37 (Bug, 2015-05-04): fixing traps with long search patterns in DevSearch
Long search patterns lead to traps in DevSearch.

Reported by Helmut Zinn, 2014-03-20.
Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 12.

#38 (Bug, 2015-05-08): report passing receiver parameter IN to VAR
IN parameters are not allowed to be passed as VAR parameters in Component Pascal.
However, in BB1.6 this rule is not enforced by the compiler for the receiver
parameter of a type-bound procedure call. Several modules in the BB1.6 distribution 
violate this rule and need to be changed too.
A proposal to fix this exists in CPC 1.7 rc5.

#39 (Bug, 2015-04-23): checking illegal use of SYSTEM.ADR function
When calling SYSTEm.ADR for a code procedure, the compiler generates a TRAP 0.

#40 (Bug, 2015-04-27): fixing concatenation of Unicode character constants
Concatenation of Ascii-character constants is supported in BB 1.6 while
concatenation of Unicode character constants leads to a compile time error message.
For example:
CONST
   asciiStr* = 41X + 61X;   (* OK *)
   unicodeStr* = 410X + 430X; (* Error: operand type inapplicable to + *)
A proposal by Luowy for a bug fix exists in CPC 1.7 rc5.

Refers to CPC 1.7 rc5 change list number 16.

#41 (Bug, 2015-04-29): fixing a register allocation problem in the compiler
The following procedure produces a trap in the compiler.

<pre>
PROCEDURE P(IN in : ARRAY 10 OF SHORTCHAR; OUT out : ARRAY 10 OF SHORTCHAR);
BEGIN
  out[Index()] := SHORT(CHR(1 + ORD(in[0])));
END P;
</pre>

The reason is that the right hand side expression is evaluated into a register
that cannot be used for a comparison operation, which is necessary for SHORTCHAR conversion.
A proposal to fix the bug exists in CPC 1.7 rc5 by changing
the register selection order.

#48 (Bug, 2015-05-19): fixes in HostPrinter
Two small fixes in HostPrinters are required.
1. dialogCommand uses an undocumented form that has negative side effects on
case sensitive file systems such as on a Novell file server. It opens
the resource file without the proper capitalization and thereby renames the
file and and confuses case sensitive tools such as git or svn.

2. the job's page counter in printing.pnum must be maintained at the
outermost job level, not per document, in order to support nested print
jobs as introduced recently in BB 1.6.
With this change it is then possible to do duplex (two sided) printing
and to start each document on a front side. It also enables one to see
how many pages are printed in total for a nested print job.

#50 (Feature, 2015-05-27): unlimited number of columns in SqlControls.Control
BB 1.6 has a limit of 40 columns for tables used to display the result of SQL queries.
This limit results from fixed size arrays used internally.
The limit is too low and allocating the arrays dynamically would
avoid the limit completely. A proposal by Josef Templ for fixing
this issue exists in CPC 1.7 rc5.

- storing multiple times on the same day adds zero entries to the history
- comments are always related to the first stamp in the focus text

#64 (Bug, 2015-10-12): Wingdings dependency in StdLinks
In BB1.6 StdLinks use the font 'Wingdings' for displaying special link and target glyphs.
This font is not available under all Windows versions (e.g. XP) and it is
not available under Wine either. It is also not available in the same form
under all Windows versions, for example the russian Windows version
needs to prepend 0F0H to the character codes, which then refer to user
defined Unicode characters. The resulting 2 byte codes still work for
most Windows versions, though.
If the default appearance is used this would require a mapping of 
the displayed text for non-english versions and a change from
SHORTCHAR to CHAR for the link and target texts.

in order to allow experimenting with different step sizes and thereby different speeds.

The output text should be opened right at the beginning
when pressing 'Start'. In BB 1.6 it is opened after all primes are computed,
which can take a very long time without the speedup facility.

The dialog should not be closed after pressing 'Start'.

In case of operating BlackBox in a shared office or in a train, for example,
it is required to offer a feature for shutting off the beep created by a call
to Dialog.Beep. The Edit->Preferences... dialog should be used for storing
the user's preference with respect to suppressing the beep or not.
It should be noted that the beep cannot be shut off by setting the speaker volume
to zero because the beep is created by using a dedicated output device
at least on many if not all Windows PCs.

2. Many 2-byte Unicode characters are dropped during export.
3. Converting links with the command 'Dialog.OpenExternal' needs to be supported.
4. The generated html should follow the XHTML standard without any exceptions. This can be done by using CSS.
5. More character and paragraph attributes need to be supported, in particular strikeout, font-size, text-align, margin-top, margin-left, width, text-indent. This is also possible by using CSS.
6. Sequences of spaces are not converted correctly.
7. Empty paragraphs are ignored in html and need to be turned into non-empty paragraphs by inserting a non-breaking space.
8. The page title should be taken from the window title, if possible.
9. Newlines should be converted into <br/> elements instead of paragraphs.
10. Attribute values that come from the input text must be html encoded.
11. The utf-8 encoding should be specified in a <meta> element in the header section in order to be used by browsers.
12. The user's setting for the default font should be used for default font face and size.
13. Links should not form a separate paragraph but should be embedded in the surrounding text.

#116 (Bug, 2016-07-27): calling Dialog.Update in the notifier of a selection box does not work as expected
Selection boxes report editing operations as a sequence of notifier calls because in the general case there may be multiple from/to ranges of affected entries. If a notifier calls Dialog.Update for its interactor this sets the selection box to the current (unfinished) state and terminates the editing operation before all changes are done.
As an example of the buggy behavior see the Info->Decode tool and try to select the first line and then the second line with a Mouse-Left click.
As a solution, it is proposed to delay the Update of a selection box in HostCFrames until all changes belonging to an editing operation have been done. This would also improved the runtime behavior from quadratic to linear.

#117 (Bug, 2016-07-24): fixes for non-local drop behavior
The following fixes are required for non-local drag-and-drops, i.e. where source and destination views are different.

1. When moving the selection from a nested view to a parent view (e.g. when using nested forms), the selection is not deleted in the source view, which effectively creates a copy operation. This unintended behavior results from an inappropriate ordering of insert and delete operations in Containers.TrackToDrop where the  insert is done first and as a side effect it can clear the selection used by the delete step.

2. The focus should be set to the drop target.

3. If the selection is not a singleton, all inserts should be grouped together by means of a script.

4. In case of moving within a shared domain, i.e. where the drop source and target have a common undo-stack, there should only be a single 'Moving' operation instead of two operations (Insert + Delete).

#118 (Bug, 2016-08-03): commander does not show error message
If a commander (DevCommanders.View) executes a command it does not show an error
message when the text following the commander is neither a quoted string nor a
qualified identifier.
This appears in particular when a double-quoted string is used for executing a
sequence of commands and the string is longer than 256 characters.
The limit of 256 characters should be lifted and an error message should be displayed
if a command is not well-formed.

#121 (Bug, 2016-08-12): compiler warning regarding unreleased register
Compiling an assignment as shown below leads to a compiler warning
resulting from a self-check contained in the compiler.
The warning is displayed in the Log window as AX.
It means that register AX has not been freed.

VAR b: BYTE;
b: = SHORT (SHORT (SHORT (FunctionReturningLONGINT())));

A proposal for a fix by luowy exists.

#122 (Feature, 2016-08-19): enabling write access to list of installed converters
The list of installed converters (anchored in Converters.list) in BlackBox 1.6 is only
available in read-only form to programs. Therefore, it is not possible, for example, 
to reorder converters or to remove converters that have been installed.
The field Converter.next would need to be exported as read+write for that purpose.

#123 (Bug, 2016-08-26): "Show Extension Interface" is not showing *Hook procedures
"Show Extension Interface" gives you information about the hooks as well.
Unfortunately, this does not show the procedure Kernel.SetLoaderHook but only the related hook types and variables.

#125 (Bug, 2016-08-31): Compiler TRAP for WITH statement
Compiling a statement of the form "WITH ELSE END" leads to a compiler TRAP.

#126 (Bug, 2016-09-02): Compiler TRAP for SYSTEM.VAL(LONGINT, intreg)
Compiling for example the expression <pre>SYSTEM.VAL(LONGINT, y * 2)</pre> with y: INTEGER leads to a compiler TRAP. The second register required for a LONGINT register pair is undefined in this case. If it happens to be a large value it leads to a TRAP when testing the register for membership in a SET of registers.

#127 (Bug, 2016-09-05): TextViews.ShowRange does not clear the auto-scroll range
A single text.Insert(...) operation followed by a TextViews.ShowRange(text, ...) does not scroll to the requested position but to the end of the insertion.
This results from the auto scroll mechanism of TextControllers, which scrolls a text lazily to the position of the last modification.
TextViews.ShowRange therefore should clear the auto scroll range if there is one.

#128 (Bug, 2016-09-12): Assignment of named empty string to ARRAY OF SHORTCHAR does not work
The assignment of a named empty string to an array of SHORTCHAR does not work.
Instead of assigning 0X to the first array element, -1 is assigned.

#129 (Feature, 2016-09-12): command for generating a compile list for a set of subsystems
A command is required for generating a list of modules in compile order for a given set of subsystems. Such a command could be used e.g. for migrating to BlackBox to 1.7, which requires recompilation of all existing sources.
