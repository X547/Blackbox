Windows Programming Interfaces

The Win subsystem contains the interface modules for the various Windows programming interfaces. The following table shows the available modules and a short desription of their contents:

module	contents

WinApi	basic data types, error codes, basic Win32 functionality
WinDlg	common dialog box library
WinCtl	common controls
WinOle	basic COM and OLE interfaces
WinOleDlg	OLE dialogs (OleUI...)
WinOleAut	OLE automation interfaces	
WinOleCtl	OLE controls interfaces
WinRpc	remote procedure call functions
WinNet	networking and socket functions
WinMM	multimedia services
WinCmc	Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
WinSql	Database services (ODBC)


Naming Conventions

Names are generally the same as in the corresponding C header and help files. An exception applies to pointers which are always named after the structure they point to with a "Ptr" prefix.
Example:

RECT = RECORD [untagged] left, top, right, bottom: INTEGER END;
PtrRECT = POINTER TO RECT;


Parameters

Parameters of pointer type are represented as variable parameters (VAR/IN/OUT) whenever possible.


Pointers to Pointers

Pointers to pointers or basic types cannot be declared directly in Component Pascal. A type of the form
p: POINTER TO ARRAY [untagged] OF BaseType;
is used instead. You can use the form p[0] to dereference such a pointer.
