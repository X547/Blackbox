#206 (Documentation, 2019-12-14): change text formatting from Default Font to Arial
In P-S-I.odc in the subsection on Stack Size, for example, there is some text that uses the Default Font instead of Arial as used throughout the docu.

#207 (Bug, 2020-06-14): Compiler TRAPs with simple CONST expression
The expression "b := (b OR ~logTop) & logTop", where logTop is the constant FALSE, causes the compiler to TRAP.

There is a suggested fix from luowy on the community forum: https://community.blackboxframework.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=246

#208 (Bug, 2020-06-29): ASSERT(FALSE) rejected by compiler
The Language Report permits ASSERT(x) where x is a Boolean expression, so the compiler should be adjusted to match the report.
