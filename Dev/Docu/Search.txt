This tool provides global search facilities (in all subsystems' Docu or Mod directories) and a text comparison feature. The search engine cooperates with module TextCmds, in that it uses the latter's find & replace interactor. This means that after having found a string using one of the search commands, the text command "Find Again" can be used to conveniently find further occurrences of the same string in the same text.

Typical menu:

MENU
	"Search In Sources"	""	"TextCmds.InitFindDialog; DevSearch.SearchInSources"	"TextCmds.SelectionGuard"
	"Search In Docu (Case Sensitive)"	""	"TextCmds.InitFindDialog; DevSearch.SearchInDocu('s')"	"TextCmds.SelectionGuard"
	"Search In Docu (Case Insensitive)"	""	"TextCmds.InitFindDialog; DevSearch.SearchInDocu('i')"	"TextCmds.SelectionGuard"
	"Compare Texts"	""	"DevSearch.Compare"	"TextCmds.FocusGuard"
END


PROCEDURE Compare
Guard: top two windows are document windows
Perform a textual comparison of the two topmost windows' contents. The comparison starts at each window's current caret position, or alternatively, at the end of its selection. The next difference which is found is indicated by advancing the caret or selection to the found difference. White space (spaces, tabs, carriage returns) are ignored during comparison.

PROCEDURE SearchInSources
Guard: TextCmds.SelectionGuard
Search all available sources (in all subsystems) for the occurrence of the selected text pattern. Search is case-sensitive.

PROCEDURE SearchInDocu (opts: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Guard: TextCmds.SelectionGuard
Search all available documentation texts (in all subsystems and in Manuals) for the occurrence of the selected text pattern. If the string opts starts with an 's' or 'S' then the search is case sensitive, if it starts with an 'i' or 'I' the search is case-insensitive and in all other cases the value from the Find dialog is used.

PROCEDURE SelectCaseInSens (pat: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Sets up TextCmds.find.find with pat, calls TextCmds.FindFirst and opens the find dialog. This procedure is used by link views created with the above procedure SearchInDocu when the search was performed case-insensitive.

PROCEDURE SelectCaseSens (pat: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Sets up TextCmds.find.find with pat and calls TextCmds.FindFirst. This procedure is used by link views created with the above procedures SearchInSource and SearchInDocu when the search was performed case-sensitive.
