This tool module allows to list all subsystems as folds (-> StdFolds). A fold contains links to its subsystem's symbol, code, source, and documentation files. It makes it easier to get an overview over the elements of a large BlackBox application, or over BlackBox itself.
For the resources of a subsystem, a Rsrc link is generated. Clicking this link creates a list of all documents in the Rsrc subdirectory.
For the documentation files, those which contain one or several dashes ("-") in their names are not treated as module documentations, but rather as auxiliary documentation files which are listed at the beginning. In particular, files with name Sys-Map, User-Man, and Dev-Man are extracted this way. They are the standard names for a map document which contains hyperlinks to the relevant files of the subsystems; the user manual for the subsystem (user in this context means a programmer); and the programmer's reference.
