Module SYSTEM

Module SYSTEM contains certain procedures that are necessary to implement low-level operations. It is strongly recommended to restrict the use of these features to specific low-level modules, as such modules are inherently non-portable and usually unsafe. SYSTEM is not considered as part of the language Component Pascal proper.

The procedures contained in module SYSTEM are listed in the following table. v stands for a variable. x, y, and n stands for expressions. T stands for a type. P stands for a procedure. M[a] stands for memory value at address a.

Function procedures
	Name	Argument types	Result type	Description
	ADR(v)	any	INTEGER	address of variable v
	ADR(P)	P: PROCEDURE	INTEGER	address of Procedure P
	ADR(T)	T: a record type	INTEGER	address of Descriptor of T
	LSH(x, n)	x, n: integer type*	type of x	logical shift (n > 0: left, n < 0: right)
	ROT(x, n)	x, n: integer type*	type of x	rotation (n > 0: left, n < 0: right)
	TYP(v)	record type	INTEGER	type tag of record variable v
	VAL(T, x)	T, x: any type	T	x interpreted as of type T
	* integer types without LONGINT

Proper procedures
	Name	Argument types	Description
	GET(a, v)	a: INTEGER; v: any basic type,	v := M[a]
		pointer type, procedure type
	PUT(a, x)	a: INTEGER; x: any basic type,	M[a] := x
		pointer type, procedure type
	GETREG(n, v)	n: integer constant, v: any basic type,	v := Register n
		pointer type, procedure type
	PUTREG(n, x)	n: integer constant, x: any basic type,	Register n := x
		pointer type, procedure type
	MOVE(a0, a1, n)	a0, a1: INTEGER; n: integer type	M[a1..a1+n-1] :=
			M[a0..a0+n-1]

The register numbers for PUTREG and GETREG are:
0: EAX, 1: ECX, 2: EDX, 3: EBX, 4: ESP, 5: EBP, 6: ESI, 7: EDI.

Warning
VAL, PUT, PUTREG, and MOVE may crash BlackBox and/or Windows when not used properly.
Never use VAL (or PUT or MOVE) to assign a value to a BlackBox pointer. Doing this would corrupt the garbage collector, with fatal consequences.

System Flags

The import of module SYSTEM allows to override some default behavior of the compiler by the usage of system flags. System flags are used to configure type- and procedure declarations. The extended syntax is given below.

Type 	=	Qualident
		| ARRAY ["[" SysFlag "]"] [ConstExpr {"," ConstExpr}]
			OF Type 
		| RECORD ["[" SysFlag "]"] ["("Qualident")"] FieldList
			{";" FieldList} END
		| POINTER ["[" SysFlag "]"] TO Type
		| PROCEDURE [FormalPars].
ProcDecl	=	PROCEDURE ["[" SysFlag "]"] [Receiver] IdentDef
			[FormalPars] ";"
		DeclSeq [BEGIN StatementSeq] END ident.
FPSection	=	[VAR ["[" SysFlag "]"]] ident {"," ident} ":" Type.
SysFlag	=	ConstExpr | ident.

For SysFlags either the name of the flag or the corresponding numeric value can be used.

System flags for record types
Name	Value	Description
untagged	1	No type tag and no type descriptor is allocated.
		The garbage collector ignores untagged variables.
		NEW is not allowed on pointers to untagged variables.
		No type-bound procedures are allowed for the record.
		Pointers to untagged record type or extensions of this
		record type inherit the attribute of being untagged.
		The offsets of the fields are aligned to
		MIN(4-byte, size), where size is the size of the field.
		The size of the record and the offsets of the fields are
		aligned to 32-bit boundaries.
noalign	3	Same as untagged but without alignment.
align2	4	Same as untagged but with
		MIN(2-byte, size) alignment. 
align8	6	Same as untagged but with
		MIN(8-byte, size) alignment. 
union	7	Untagged record with all fields allocated at offset 0.
		The size of the record is equal to the size of the
		largest field.
		Used to emulate C union types.

System flags for array types
Name	Value	Description
untagged	1	No typetag and no type descriptor is allocated.
		The garbage collector ignores untagged variables.
		NEW is not allowed on pointers to untagged variables.
		Pointers to this array type inherit the attribute of
		being untagged.
		Only one-dimensional untagged open arrays
		are allowed.
		For open untagged arrays, index bounds are
		not checked.

System flags for pointer types
Name	Value	Description
untagged	1	Not traced by the garbage collector.
		No type-bound procedures are allowed for the pointer.
		Must point to an untagged record.

System flags for VAR parameters
Name	Value	Description
nil	1	NIL is accepted as formal parameter.
		Used in interfaces to C
		functions with pointer type parameters.

System flags for procedures
Name	Value	Description
code	1	Definition of a Code procedure (see below).
ccall	-10	Procedure uses CCall calling convention.

Code procedures

Code procedures make it possible to use special code sequences not generated by the compiler. They are declared using the following special syntax:

ProcDecl	=	PROCEDURE "[" SysFlag "]" IdentDef [FormalPars]
			[ConstExpr {"," ConstExpr}] ";".

The list of constants declared with the procedure is interpreted as a byte string and directly inserted in the code ("in-line") whenever the procedure is called. If a parameter list is supplied, the actual parameters are pushed on the stack from right to left. The first parameter however is kept in a register. If the type of the first parameter is REAL or SHORTREAL, it is stored in the top floating-point register. Otherwise the parameter (or in the case of a VAR/IN/OUT parameter its address) is loaded into EAX. For function procedures the result is also expected to be either in the top floating-point register or in EAX, depending on its type. Be careful when using registers in code procedures. In general, the registers ECX, EDX, ESI, and EDI may be used. Parameters on the stack must be removed by the procedure.

Examples

	PROCEDURE [code] Sqrt (x: REAL): REAL		(* Math.Sqrt *)
		0D9H, 0FAH;			(* FSQRT *)

	PROCEDURE [code] Erase (adr, words: INTEGER)	(* erase memory area *)
		089H, 0C7H,			(* MOV EDI, EAX *)
		031H, 0C0H,			(* XOR EAX, EAX *)
		059H,			(* POP ECX *)
		0F2H, 0ABH;			(* REP STOS *)


Using DLLs in BlackBox modules

Any 32-bit DLL can be imported in Component Pascal like a normal Component Pascal module. This holds for Windows system modules (kernel, user, gdi, ...) as well as for any custom DLL written in any programming language. Be aware that the safety qualities of Component Pascal (no dangling pointers, strict type-checking, etc.) are lost if you interface to a DLL written in another programming language.

Interface modules

Type information about objects imported from a DLL must be present in a symbol file for the compiler to work properly. Such special symbol files can be generated through so-called interface modules. An interface module is a Component Pascal module marked by a system flag after the module name. The system flag consists of the name of the corresponding DLL enclosed in square brackets. An interface module can only contain declarations of constants, types, and procedures headings. No code file is generated when an interface module is compiled.

Name aliasing

The Component Pascal name of an object imported from a DLL can be different from the corresponding name in the export table of the DLL. To achieve this the DLL name is appended to the Component Pascal name as a system flag. In addition, the system flag may specify a different DLL than the one declared in the module header. This allows to use a single interface module for a whole set of related DLLs. It is also possible to have multiple interface modules referring to the same DLL.  Interface procedures cannot have a body, nor an "END identifier" part, they are only signatures.

The extend syntax for interface modules is given below:

Module 	=	MODULE ident ["[" SysString "]"] ";"
		[ImportList] DeclSeq  [BEGIN StatementSeq] END ident ".".
ProcDecl	=	PROCEDURE ["[" SysFlag "]"] [Receiver]
		IdentDef ["[" [SysString ","] SysString "]"] [FormalPars] ";"
		DeclSeq [[BEGIN StatementSeq] END ident].
SysString	=	string.

There is no aliasing for types and constants, because they are not present in export lists and thus may have arbitrary names.
The following example summarizes the aliasing capabilities:

MODULE MyInterface ["MyDll"];
	PROCEDURE Proc1*;				(* Proc1 from MyDll *)
	PROCEDURE Proc2* ["BlaBla"];				(* BlaBla from MyDll *)
	PROCEDURE Proc3* ["OtherDll", ""];				(* Proc3 from OtherDll *)
	PROCEDURE Proc4* ["OtherDll", "DoIt"];				(* DoIt from OtherDll *)
END MyInterface.

A SysString for a DLL may not contain an entire path name. It should be just the name of the DLL, without the ".dll" suffix. The following search strategy is used:

- BlackBox directory
- Windows\System directory
- Windows directory

Data types in interface modules

Always use untagged records as replacements for C structures, in order to avoid the allocation of a type tag for the garbage collector. The system flag [untagged] marks a type as untagged (no type information is available at run-time) with standard alignment rules for record fields (2-byte fields are aligned to 2-byte boundaries, 4-byte or larger fields to 4-byte boundaries). The system flags [noalign], [align2], and [align8] also identify untagged types but with different alignments for record fields.
Like all system flags, "untagged" can only be used if module SYSTEM is imported.

Example:

	RECORD [noalign]	(* untagged, size = 7 bytes *)
		c: SHORTCHAR;	(* offset 0, size = 1 byte *)
		x: INTEGER;	(* offset 1 , size = 4 bytes *)
		i: SHORTINT	(* offset 5, size = 2 bytes *)
	END

Procedures

Component Pascal procedure calls conform to the StdCall calling convention (parameters pushed from right to left, removed by called procedure). If the CCall convention (parameters removed by caller) is needed for some DLL procedures, the corresponding procedure declaration in the interface module must be decorated with the [ccall] system flag.
No special handling is required for callback procedures.

For parameters of type POINTER TO T it is often better to use a variable parameter of type T rather than to declare a corresponding pointer type. Declare the VAR parameter with system flag [nil] if NIL must be accepted as legal actual parameter.

Example:

C:	
	BOOL MoveToEx(HDC hdc, int X, int Y, LPPOINT lpPoint)

Component Pascal:
	PROCEDURE MoveToEx* (dc: Handle; x, y: INTEGER; VAR [nil] old: Point): Bool

Correspondence between Component Pascal and C data types

unsigned char	= SHORTCHAR	(1 byte)
WCHAR	= CHAR	(2 bytes)
signed char	= BYTE	(1 byte)
short	= SHORTINT	(2 bytes)
int	= INTEGER	(4 bytes)
long	= INTEGER	(4 bytes)
LARGE_INTEGER	= LONGINT	(8 bytes)
float	= SHORTREAL	(4 bytes)
double	= REAL	(8 bytes)

Note that Bool is not a data type in C but is defined as int (= INTEGER). 0 and 1 must be used for assignments of FALSE and TRUE and comparisons with 0 have to be used in conditional statements (IF b # 0 THEN ... END instead of IF b THEN ... END).

Note that it is not possible to unload a DLL from within BlackBox. To avoid having to exit and restart your development environment repeatedly, it is a good idea to test the DLL that you are developing from within another instance of the BlackBox application.


Using COM without special Direct-To-COM compiler

Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) is supported by a special Component Pascal compiler that is available as an add-on product to BlackBox. This compiler makes using COM safer and more convenient. However, for casual use of COM, the approach described in this chapter can be used. It doesn't require a special compiler version. It uses normal untagged records and procedure variables to create COM-style method tables ("vtbl") for objects. The following example shows how it works:

MODULE Ddraw ["DDRAW.DLL"];

TYPE
  GUID = ARRAY 4 OF INTEGER;

  PtrIUnknown = POINTER TO RECORD [untagged]
    vtbl: POINTER TO RECORD [untagged]
      QueryInterface: PROCEDURE (this: PtrIUnknown; IN iid: GUID; OUT obj: PtrIUnknown): INTEGER;
      AddRef: PROCEDURE (this: PtrIUnknown): INTEGER;
      Release: PROCEDURE (this: PtrIUnknown): INTEGER;
    END
  END;

  PtrDirectDraw = POINTER TO RECORD [untagged]
    vtbl: POINTER TO RECORD [untagged]
      QueryInterface: PROCEDURE (this: PtrDirectDraw; IN iid: GUID; OUT obj: PtrIUnknown): INTEGER;
      AddRef: PROCEDURE (this: PtrDirectDraw): INTEGER;
      Release: PROCEDURE (this: PtrDirectDraw): INTEGER;
      Compact: PROCEDURE (this: PtrDirectDraw): INTEGER;
      ...
      SetCooperativeLevel: PROCEDURE (this: PtrDirectDraw; w, x: INTEGER): INTEGER;
      ...
    END
  END;

PROCEDURE DirectDrawCreate* (IN guid: GUID; OUT PDD: PtrDirectDraw; outer: PtrIUnknown) : INTEGER;

END Ddraw.


MODULE Directone;

IMPORT Out, Ddraw, SYSTEM;

CONST
  DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE = 00000010H;
  DDSCL_FULLSCREEN = 00000001H;

PROCEDURE Initialize;
VAR 
  Handle, Addr, Res: INTEGER;
  PDD: Ddraw.PtrDirectDraw;
  nul: Ddraw.GUID;
BEGIN
  PDD := NIL;
  nul[0] := 0; nul[1] := 0; nul[2] := 0; nul[3] := 0;
  Res := Ddraw.DirectDrawCreate(nul, PDD, NIL);
  Out.String("Res");  Out.Int(Res, 8);  Out.Ln();
  Res := SYSTEM.VAL(INTEGER, PDD);
  Out.String("Res");  Out.Int(Res, 8);  Out.Ln();
  Res := PDD.vtbl.SetCooperativeLevel(PDD, 0, DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE + DDSCL_FULLSCREEN);
  Out.String("Res");  Out.Int(Res, 8);  Out.Ln();
  Res := PDD.vtbl.Release(PDD)
END Initialize;

BEGIN
  Initialize
END Directone.


Some important points:
â¢ COM GUIDs are 128 bit entities, not integers.
â¢ DO NOT use ANYPTR or other BlackBox pointers for COM interface pointers. (BlackBox pointers are garbage collected, COM pointers are referenece counted.)
â¢ Use pointers to [untagged] records or integers instead.

Be careful to declare all methods in the method table in the correct order with the correct parameter list.

Windows-specific information in BlackBox

Windows -specific cursors

The module HostPorts exports constants for Windows-specific cursors which can be used like the standard cursors defined in module Ports:

	CONST
		resizeHCursor = 16;	(* cursors used for window resizing *)
		resizeVCursor = 17;
		resizeLCursor = 18;
		resizeRCursor = 19;
		resizeCursor = 20;
		busyCursor = 21;	(* busy cursor *)
		stopCursor = 22;	(* drag and drop cursors *)
		moveCursor = 23;
		copyCursor = 24;
		linkCursor = 25;
		pickCursor = 26;	(* drag and pick cursor *)
		
Windows-specific mouse and keyboard modifiers

Modifier sets are used in Controllers.TrackMsg, Controllers.EditMsg, and Ports.Frame.Input. In addition to the platform independant modifiers Controllers.doubleClick, Controllers.extend, and Controllers.modify they contain platform-specific modifiers defined in HostPorts:

	CONST
		left = 16;	(* left mouse button pressed *)
		middle = 17;	(* middle mouse button pressed *)
		right = 18;	(* right mouse button pressed *)
		shift = 24;	(* Shift key pressed *)
		ctrl = 25;	(* Control key pressed *)
		alt = 28;	(* Alt key pressed *)

Window and device context handles

Many of the functions in the Windows API refer either to a window or to a device context handle. In the Windows BlackBox implementation, both of them are stored in the HostPorts.Port record:

	TYPE
		Port = POINTER TO RECORD (Ports.PortDesc)
			dc: WinApi.Handle;
			wnd: WinApi.Handle
		END;
	
In the usual case where a frame (Ports.Frame or Views.Frame) is given, the handles can be obtained through one of the following selectors:

		frame.rider(HostPorts.Rider).port.dc
		or
		frame.rider(HostPorts.Rider).port.wnd

If the window handle is null, the port is a printer port.
		
Examples

The following simple DLL definition is a subset of the Windows standard library GDI32:

MODULE GDI ["GDI32"];

	CONST
		WhiteBrush* = 0; BlackBrush* = 4; NullBrush* = 5;
		WhitePen* = 6; BlackPen* = 7; NullPen* = 8;
		PSSolid* = 0; PSDash* = 1; PSDot* = 2;

	TYPE
		Bool* = INTEGER;
		Handle* = INTEGER;
		ColorRef* = INTEGER;
		Point* = RECORD [untagged] x*, y*: INTEGER END;
		Rect* = RECORD [untagged] left*, top*, right*, bottom*: INTEGER END;

	PROCEDURE CreatePen* (style, width: INTEGER; color: ColorRef): Handle;
	PROCEDURE CreateSolidBrush* (color: ColorRef): Handle;
	PROCEDURE GetStockObject* (object: INTEGER): Handle;
	PROCEDURE SelectObject* (dc, obj: Handle): Handle;
	PROCEDURE DeleteObject* (obj: Handle): Bool;
	PROCEDURE Rectangle* (dc: Handle; left, top, right, bottom: INTEGER): Bool;
	PROCEDURE SelectClipRgn* (dc, rgn: Handle): INTEGER;
	PROCEDURE IntersectClipRect* (dc: Handle; left, top, right, bottom: INTEGER): INTEGER;
	PROCEDURE SaveDC* (dc: Handle): INTEGER;
	PROCEDURE RestoreDC* (dc: Handle; saved: INTEGER): Bool;

END GDI.

The following example is a simplified version of the BlackBox standard DrawRect routines implemented in Ports and HostPorts. It uses the GDI interface presented above.

MODULE Ex;

	IMPORT Ports, HostPorts, GDI;

	PROCEDURE DrawRect (f: Ports.Frame; l, t, r, b, s: INTEGER; col: Ports.Color);
		VAR res, h, rl, rt, rr, rb: INTEGER; p: HostPorts.Port; dc, oldb, oldp: GDI.Handle;
	BEGIN
		(* change local universal coordinates to window pixel coordinates *)
		l := (f.gx + l) DIV f.unit; t := (f.gy + t) DIV f.unit;
		r := (f.gx + r) DIV f.unit; b := (f.gy + b) DIV f.unit;
		s := s DIV f.unit;
		(* get device context *)
		p := f.rider(HostPorts.Rider).port; dc := p.dc;
		(* set clip region *)
		IF p.wnd = 0 THEN res := GDI.SaveDC(dc)
		ELSE res := GDI.SelectClipRgn(dc, 0)
		END;
		f.rider.GetRect(rl, rt, rr, rb);
		res := GDI.IntersectClipRect(dc, rl, rt, rr, rb);
		(* use black as default color *)
		IF col = Ports.defaultColor THEN col := Ports.black END;
		IF s = 0 THEN s := 1 END;
		IF (s < 0) OR (r-l < 2*s) OR (b-t < 2*s) THEN	(* filled rectangle *)
			INC(r); INC(b);
			oldb := GDI.SelectObject(dc, GDI.CreateSolidBrush(col));
			oldp := GDI.SelectObject(dc, GDI.GetStockObject(GDI.NullPen));
			res := GDI.Rectangle(dc, l, t, r, b);
			res := GDI.DeleteObject(GDI.SelectObject(dc, oldb));
			res := GDI.SelectObject(dc, oldp)
		ELSE	(* outline rectangle *)
			h := s DIV 2; INC(l, h); INC(t, h); h := (s-1) DIV 2; DEC(r, h); DEC(b, h);
			oldb := GDI.SelectObject(dc, GDI.GetStockObject(GDI.NullBrush));
			oldp := GDI.SelectObject(dc, GDI.CreatePen(GDI.PSSolid, s, col));
			res := GDI.Rectangle(dc, l, t, r, b);
			res := GDI.SelectObject(dc, oldb);
			res := GDI.DeleteObject(GDI.SelectObject(dc, oldp))
		END;
		IF p.wnd = 0 THEN res := GDI.RestoreDC(dc, -1) END
	END DrawRect;

END Ex.


Runtime type system

All dynamically allocated Component Pascal records contain a hidden field, which is called the type tag. The type tag points to the type descriptor that contains all type information needed at runtime. Calls of type-bound procedures, type tests and the garbage collector all use the information which is stored in the type descriptor. The type descriptor is allocated only once for every record type in the system.
Dynamically allocated arrays use a size descriptor to check the bounds of indexes. The size descriptor also contains the type tag of the element type. For every single dynamic array a size descriptor is needed.


Differences between different Windows versions
Tree controls look different on Windows NT compared to other versions of Windows. There is a defect in the routine for drawing the background of a Tree control in Windows NT. Hence, BlackBox does not change the color of the background for a disabled or read only tree control under Windows NT, whereas with other windows versions the background is set to gray when the control is disabled or read only.


The BlackBox linker

See the DevLinker documentation.

Linking BlackBox applications

If you want to distribute an application you have written in BlackBox, you may want to link all modules into a single file for distribution. In this case you need to link the framework to your application. To illustrate the necessary actions we will give an example. First duplicate the BlackBox application in the Explorer and rename it accordingly, in our case "Patterns". Adapt the module Config to your needs, e.g., delete the call which automatically opens the Log text. Then link the framework with your modules into the new application file. You may need to distribute some additional files with your application such as forms and the Menu text.

MODULE Config;

	IMPORT Dialog;

	PROCEDURE Setup*;
		VAR res: INTEGER;
	BEGIN
		Dialog.Call("ObxPatterns.Deposit; StdCmds.Open", "", res)
	END Setup;

END Config.

Startup of BlackBox

The startup of BlackBox happens in several steps.

Step 1: The operating system starts the application

BlackBox consists of a small linked application and many unlinked code files (one per module). The linked application consists of at least the BlackBox Kernel module. When the operating system starts up BlackBox, it gives control to the module body of Kernel.

Step 2: The kernel loads all prelinked modules

The kernel initializes its data structures, in particular for memory management and exception handling. Then it executes the module bodies of the other modules which are linked in the application, in the correct order.
Usually, the module StdLoader is among the prelinked modules, along with several modules that it needs, in particular Files and HostFiles. Module StdLoader implements the linking loader which can dynamically link and load a module's code file. 

Step 3: Init loads the BlackBox library and core framework

The standard implementation of module StdLoader performs a call to module Init in its body. If Init isn't linked, this causes the loader to attempt loading the code file System/Code/Init. If loading is possible, the modules imported by Init are loaded and initialized first, and then Init itself is initialized, i.e., its module body is executed.
The standard implementation of Init imports all core framework modules and their standard implementations, but not extension subsystems such as the Text or Form subsystem. These modules are loaded before the body of Init performs the following actions:

â¢ It tries to call Startup.Setup.
Usually, module Startup does not exist. It could be used to install some services before the main window is opened and before the text subsystem or other subsystems are loaded.

â¢ It tries to load module DevDebug.
DevDebug is expected to replace the kernel's rudimentary exception handling facilities by a more convenient tool. Note that the standard implementation of DevDebug uses the text subsystem, which thus is loaded also.
If loading of DevDebug is not successful, it is attempted to load module StdDebug. This is a reduced version of DevDebug which can be distributed along with an application.

â¢ It registers the document file converter (importer/exporter).
This enables BlackBox to open and save standard BlackBox documents.

â¢ It tries to call StdMenuTool.UpdateAllMenus.
This command reads and interprets the System/Rsrc/Menus text, and builds up the  menus accordingly. Note that the standard implementation of StdMenuTool uses the text subsystem.

â¢ It tries to call Config.Setup.
This is the usual way to configure BlackBox. The standard implementation of Config.Setup  installs the standard file and OLE converters and opens the log text.

â¢ It calls the main event loop (HostMenus.Run).
After the event loop is left (because the user wants to quit the application), the kernel is called to clean up, before the application is left entirely.


Using NEW and garbage collection in your applications

If you are calling NEW in your application and thereby implicitly use the garbage collector, you must link the Kernel into the application. The NEW-procedure is implemented in the kernel, the compiler just generates the code to call this procedure. So every module using NEW has a hidden import of the kernel.
Don't call WinApi.ExitProcess directly when "importing" the kernel, call Kernel.Quit with parameter 0 instead to assure that occupied system resources get properly released before the application is terminated.

Programs don't need to call the garbage collector explicitly. If the NEW-procedure cannot satisfy a request for heap space, it calls the garbage collector internally before allocating a new heap block from the Windows Memory Manager. The garbage collector marks pointers in stack frames and is able to run anytime.

The garbage collector reclaims all heap objects (dynamic record or array variables) that are not used anymore. "Unused" means that the object isn't directly reachable from some "root" pointer, or indirectly via a pointer chain starting from a root pointer. Any global variable which contains a pointer is such a root. If a root pointer isn't NIL, then it "anchors" a data structure. A heap object that isn't anchored anymore will eventually be collected by the garbage collector.

To allow the collector to follow pointer chains, there must be some information about the heap objects that are being traversed. In particular, it must be known where there are pointers in the object, if any. All objects of the same type share a common type descriptor, which is created when its defining module is loaded.
All dynamically allocated Component Pascal records contain a hidden field, which is called the type tag. The type tag points to the type descriptor that contains all type information needed at run-time. Method calls, type tests and the garbage collector all use the information which is stored in the type descriptor. The type descriptor is allocated only once for every record type in the system.
Dynamically allocated arrays use a size descriptor to check the bounds of indexes. The size descriptor also contains the type tag of the element type. For every single dynamic array a size descriptor is needed.

The additional storage required to "tag" objects makes their memory layout different from untagged records provided by the operating system or some procedural shared library. Type tags are critical; they must not be damaged, otherwise the garbage collector will crash the system at some point in time.
