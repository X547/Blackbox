Command package for the Component Pascal compiler. The compiler has no compiler options. Safety-critical runtime checks are always performed (type guards, array range checks, etc.), while non-critical runtime checks may not be generated (SHORT, integer overflows, testing of set membership). "Critical" means that non-local memory may be destroyed, with unknown global effects.

PROCEDURE Compile
Guard: TextCmds.FocusGuard
Compile the Component Pascal module whose source is in the focus view.

PROCEDURE CompileAndUnload
Guard: TextCmds.FocusGuard
Compile the module whose source is in the focus view. If compilation is successful, it is attempted to unload the old version of this module. CompileAndUnload is convenient when developing top-level modules, i.e., modules which are not imported by any other modules, and thus can be unloaded individually.

PROCEDURE CompileModuleList
Guard: TextCmds.SelectionGuard
Compile the list of modules whose names are selected. When the first error is detected, the offending source is opened to show the error.

PROCEDURE CompileSelection
Guard: TextCmds.SelectionGuard
Compile the module, whose beginning is selected.

PROCEDURE CompileThis
Used in a text with a DevCommanders.View. This command takes the text following it and interprets it as a list of modules that should be compiled. Similar to CompileModuleList except that no selection is necessary.
