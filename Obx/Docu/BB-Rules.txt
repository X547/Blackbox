The rules for playing BlackBox

The objective of the game is to find the form of a hidden molecule. The molecule consists of several atoms which are placed on the grid. To find out more about the hidden molecule, rays must be fired into the grid. The rays may be deflected or even absorbed by the atoms. From the position where a fired ray leaves the grid, the positions of the atoms have to be deduced. Only the reaction of the atoms on the fired rays is available, thus the name black box for this game.

Below, the possible influences of the atoms on the rays are described and illustrated with examples.

How to play BlackBox

To start the game, open the BlackBox dialog box. You may install a command into your menu to open this dialog. In the dialog you can define the size of the board and the number of atoms the computer will hide for you. When you click onto the OK button, a new window will appear which contains a new BlackBox puzzle. At the bottom of the view the number of hidden atoms is indicated.

To fire a ray into the grid, click into one of the locations on the edge of the grid. The result will be displayed immediately. Obviously this operation cannot be undone.

To tell the program where you think an atom is, click on the grid location. This will tentatively place an atom at that location. If you later decide that the atom should not be there, click on the square again, and it will disappear. When you think you have placed all of the atoms correctly, select Show Solution  from the BlackBox menu and the computer will check the atoms that you placed and reveal any that you missed or placed incorrectly. In addition, a score will be displayed. The smaller the score, the better the result. Every ray which has been fired is counted with two points, except for absorbed and reflected ones which are only counted with one point. Additionally, for every misplaced atom five points are added. For an eight by eight board with four hidden atoms the average score is between ten and fifteen. Once the solution has been shown, you can visualize the path a ray will follow by clicking into the edge of the grid while holding down the modifier key.

If you execute the menu entry New Atoms, then the computer will hide a new molecule for you which consists of the same number of atoms as the last one.

If you want to generate a new puzzle for someone else, then place the atoms on the grid and select the Set New Atoms  command. The number of the hidden atoms will be updated accordingly. You may save and mail such a puzzle to your friends.


Some background information

BlackBox has been invented by the English mathematician Dr. Eric W. Solomon. All the games he invented are distinguished by the fact that they are easy and simple, but very interesting. In other words, his games are in the spirit of Oberon, namely as simple as possible, but not simpler.

BlackBox got published in Germany under the names Logo and Ordo in 1978 but was withdrawn already two years later. It is now again available from the franjos company under its original name BlackBox in a nice edition (wooden stones and atoms made out of glass). Other games invented by Solomon are Sigma File and Vice Versa. The latter has also been published under the name Hyle.

The objective of the game is not to deduce the hidden position of all atoms completely, but rather to score with as few points as possible. Thus, in some situation it may be better to apply some intuition than firing additional rays.
