Overview by Example: ObxTabs

This example demonstrates a simple text transformation: the first, second and seventh tab character in each text line, starting from the beginning of a text selection, is transformed into a blank. Actually, this command was used to prepare some of the addresses to which the first issue of The Oberon Tribune was sent.
