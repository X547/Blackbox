An Omosi view consists of an area filled with triangles. Each of these triangles may take on one of four colors. By clicking on a triangle, it changes it color. By shift-clicking, several triangles can be selected, which will change colors simultaneously. By clicking on a triangle with the ctrl key held down, a color palette dialog pops up which allows to map this color state to another RGB color.
