Oberon by Example: ObxFact

This example demonstrates the use of module Integers, which implements arbitrary precision integers. The example implements the command ObxFact.Compute, which computes the factorial of an integer selected as text in a text view, and replaces the selection with the result.

Example:
	25	->	15511210043330985984000000
	
Note: The time required to compute a factorial grows exponentially with the size of the input. For numbers greater than 500 a considerable time will be needed.
