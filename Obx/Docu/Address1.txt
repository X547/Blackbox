Overview by Example: ObxAddress1

This example combines some features of the previous examples: it takes the address record of ObxAddress1  and adds behavior to it. Such a record, whose fields are displayed by controls, is called an interactor.

The behavior for our example interactor is defined by the global OpenText procedure. It creates a new text, into which it writes all the fields of the address record. The fields are written as one line of text, separated by tabulators and terminated by a carriage return. A new text view on this text is then opened in a window.

After the example has been compiled, and after a form has been created for it and turned into a dialog, you can enter something into the fields (note that customer only accepts numeric values). Then click on the OpenText button. A window will be opened with a contents similar to the following:

Oberon microsystems	Technoparkstrasse 1	ZÃ¼rich	ZH	8005	Switzerland	1	$TRUE

In this example, we have seen how behavior can be added to interactors, by assigning global procedures to their procedure-typed fields.
