Overview by Example: ObxAddress2

This example combines features of earlier examples: it allows to enter an address via a mask, and a push button causes the entered data to be appended to a text in a file. Afterwards, the entered data is cleared again. Controls must be notified when a program modifies an interactor. For this purpose, there is the Dialog.Update procedure which takes an interactor as parameter.
