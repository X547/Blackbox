Overview by Example: ObxLinks

This example demonstrates how a text can be created which contains link views. The text represents the contents of a directory. There is a link for each subdirectory, and a link for each file that can be converted into a view. Thus this example also demonstrates how files and locators are enumerated and how file converters are used.
