Overview by Example: ObxPhoneDB

This example is described in chapterÂ 3 of the BlackBox tutorial.


DEFINITION ObxPhoneDB;

	TYPE String = ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;

	PROCEDURE LookupByIndex (index: INTEGER; OUT name, number: String);
	PROCEDURE LookupByName (name: String; OUT number: String);
	PROCEDURE LookupByNumber (number: String; OUT name: String);

END ObxPhoneDB.


Module ObxPhoneDB provides access to a phone database. Access may happen by index, by name, or by number. An entry consists of a name and a phone number string. Neither may be empty. The smallest index is 0, and all entries are contiguous.


PROCEDURE LookupByIndex (index: INTEGER; OUT name, number: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Return the <name, number> pair of entry index. If the index is too large, <"", ""> is returned.
The procedure operates in constant time.

Pre
index >= 0	20

Post
index is legal
	name # ""  &  number # ""
index is not legal
	name = ""  &  number = ""

PROCEDURE LookupByName (name: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT number: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Returns a phone number associated with name, or "" if no entry for name is found.
The procedure operates in linear time, depending on the size of the database.

Post
name found
	number # ""
name not found
	number = ""

PROCEDURE LookupByNumber (number: ARRAY OF CHAR; OUT name: ARRAY OF CHAR)
Returns the name associated with number, or "" if no entry for number is found.
The procedure operates in linear time, depending on the size of the database.

Post
number found
	name # ""
number not found
	name = ""
